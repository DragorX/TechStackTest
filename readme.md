# TechStackTest
 Test task for TechStack Co.

Unfortunately, I did not have enough time and current knowledge to implement all the points of the assignment.
But it was interesting for me to make up, understand and study. I would like to continue working on this project in order to fully understand all the tasks and to gain experience.
Thanks for the opportunity!

Also, there are some problems with img position in the first section. I don't know how to solve it. [fixed]
